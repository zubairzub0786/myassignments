

1) What is Selenium? What are the different Selenium components? Explain about Selenium Webdriver.
     Selenium is an automation testing tool used to test web-based applications. Selenium is not a single tool but a suite of tools.
   There are four components of Selenium – Selenium IDE, RC, WebDriver, and Grid. Last two being the most famous one.


2) How does Selenium communicate with the Web browsers?
    Selenium Script creates an HTTP Request for each selenium command and sends it to the browser driver. An HTTP request is then sent to the server using Browser Driver. 
 The steps are executed on the HTTP server. The execution status is sent to the HTTP server which is then captured by the automation script


3.What are the locators available  to find an element using Selenium?
   id
   name
   classname
   linktext
   partial linktext
   tag name
   css selector
   xpath

4. Why ID is preferable than X-Path? 
    By.ID() is the faster technique because at its root, the call goes down to document. getElementById(), which is optimized by most browsers. 
 But, finding elements using XPath is better for locating elements having complex selectors, and is no doubt the most flexible selection strategy.


5.How to select value in dropdown?
   Select Option from Drop-Down Box
      Import the “Select” package.
      Declare the drop-down element as an instance of the Select class. In the example below, we named this instance as “drpCountry”.
      We can now start controlling “drpCountry” by using any of the available Select methods to select dropdown in Selenium.



6) What is the difference between Absolute Path and Relative Path?
    An absolute path is defined as specifying the location of a file or directory from the root directory(/). In other words,we can say that an absolute path is a complete path from start of actual file system from / directory. 
Relative path is defined as the path related to the present working directly(pwd).


7) How to verify if the given check box is checked or not (it is not taught but you can explore) Try here: http://leafground.com/pages/checkbox.html

           WebElement checkBoxSelected1 = driver.findElement(By.locator(""));
			boolean isSelected1 = checkBoxSelected1.isSelected();

			if(isSelected1 == true) {
				System.out.println("Checkbox is selected");
}
else {
		        System.out.println("Checkbox is not selected");
	}

8)Difference between System.setProperty and WebDriverManager
                 WebDriverManager- It verifies the version of the browser installed in our local machine by its own. It also uses the latest version of the driver. It makes it easy 
                                   and convert the manual stuff into automation.
                System.setProperty- Before Starting to automate the web application, we need to download the driver executable manually for the required browser. After downloading, we need
                                    to set the path. All the time, we should to keep upadted version, else it will not work.                


9) Write the syntax for preceding and following x-paths.
                  ElderCousin to YoungerCousin- Eldercousin XPath/Following::tagname of the younger cousin
                  YoungerCousin to ElderCousin -Youngercousin XPath/Preceeding::tagname of the Elder cousin


10) How to get an attribute value using Selenium WebDriver?
                   By using of getAttribute(). It is a method helps to get the value of any attribute of a web element, which is returned as a string.
